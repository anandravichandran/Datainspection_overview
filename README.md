# Cybersecurity Chrome Extension with Sensitive Data Analysis

This project is a Chrome extension designed to enhance cybersecurity by analyzing sensitive data on webpages using machine learning and deep learning techniques. The extension processes the data on the page, identifies sensitive information, and provides insights based on the analysis. The core of the project involves a trained model that utilizes both machine learning and deep learning algorithms to detect and evaluate the risk associated with sensitive data.

## Features

- **Sensitive Data Detection**: Uses machine learning and deep learning to identify sensitive data such as personal information, credit card numbers, and other confidential content.
- **Real-Time Analysis**: Runs in real-time as the user navigates different web pages, analyzing the content for potential risks.
- **User Interface**: A clean and intuitive UI that displays results, alerts, and actionable insights regarding sensitive data.
- **Integration with Chrome**: Seamlessly integrates with the browser, providing on-demand analysis while maintaining a lightweight footprint.
  
## Installation

## Training the Model

The machine learning and deep learning models used in the extension are trained on various datasets to recognize sensitive information. To retrain or improve the model:


1. Use the provided training scripts to train the model on your custom dataset.

2. Once trained, export the model in a format that can be integrated into the extension.

## Usage
